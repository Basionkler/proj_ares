GUIDELINE TO INSTALL COMPOSER IN YOUR PROJECT FOLDER

- Open the terminal
- From the terminal, go to your project folder 
- type the following commands:

	• php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');"
	• php -r "if (hash_file('SHA384', 'composer-setup.php') === '669656bab3166a7aff8a7506b8cb2d1c292f042046c5a994c43155c0be6190fa0355160742ab2e1c88d40d5be660b410') { echo 'Installer verified'; } else { echo 'Installer corrupt'; unlink('composer-setup.php'); } echo PHP_EOL;"
	• php composer-setup.php
	• php -r "unlink('composer-setup.php');"
- Now you can launch composer commands from terminal, using following statement:
• php composer.phar [command]

- If everything worked, the DoctrineMigrationsBundle can now be found at vendor/doctrine/doctrine-migrations-bundle.
